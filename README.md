## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Kellen and Im currently a full time student in computer science after finishing my time in the army. 

currently I am focusing on learning about Java and dabbling in Python.

I am interested in Video game development, but solving problems through coding is facsinating to me and I would love to work on more problems that help people.
